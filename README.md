# Super-Reso
PyTorch implementation of a Real-ESRGAN model trained on custom dataset.

> This is not an official implementation. We partially use code from the [original repository](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)

Real-ESRGAN is an upgraded [ESRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219) trained with pure synthetic data is capable of enhancing details while removing annoying artifacts for common real-world images.
